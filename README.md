# Diabetes Data Analysis

##  Diabetes & Age Distribution 
Out of 768 patients, 500 didn't have diabetes & 268 did. Regarding age, just over half of the patients in the study are between 21 and 30 years old and the other half are patients between 31 and 81 years old. Therefore, the proportion of young adults in the study is higher than that of adults and elders.

## Investigating Glucose Levels 
It's shown on the histrograms bellow that the majority (94%) of patients with diabetes (positive) have glucose levels between 100 and 199, while the majority (91.8%) of patients without diabetes (negative) have glucose levels between 50 and 149.

## Investigating Insulin Levels
Regarding Insulin levels you can observer bellow that the graphs do not appear to have drastic differences, negative patients have most of their insulin levels between 0 and 199 (91.6%), whereas positive patients have a slightly lower frequency between 0 and 199 (82.5 %), that is, they have a greater distribution of insulin levels between 200 and 800.
